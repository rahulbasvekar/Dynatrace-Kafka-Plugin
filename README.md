#  Dynatrace-Kafka-Plugin
The Dynatrace-Kafka-Plugin is based on the JMX Plugin and allows the Dynatrace OneAgent to collect JMX based metrics associated with the Kafka Broker, Kafka Consumers and Kafka Producers. 

## Requirements
* Dynatrace Environment with OneAgent Installed on Kafka hosts
* Dynatrace Environment permissions to upload custom plugins
## Installation
For this plugin to work, a OneAgent must be installed on the host where the JMX emitting process is running.  
## Installation on your Dynatrace Tenant
* From the 'Settings' -> 'Monitoring' -> 'Monitored Technologies' section, select 'Custom plugins' tab
* Click on the button 'Upload Plugin' and select the Kafka.json files you wish to use.

## Limitations
* JMX monitoring is highly dynamic. If a particular metric doesn’t exist in your JVM, it's not an error—the metric simply isn't available.
